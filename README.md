this website is a bookstore for students from high or primary school and also for college students to meet there are needs for education.
The site has many functions but I will be going through a few just to get the feel of the site:
-> Firstname function () which is the login/sign for both students and admin the back will go search for the values that will match already stored value and if not found
the site will request for the user to register and ect
->Second Function is the homepage for the student it displays links to another page to view and input values in them and it contains a slide show of the story of the reason why the site was created
and also the footer link does not work.
->Third function is the buy function/page it displays all the books that are found  in the system giving the user the option to add them to the ca and etc.
->The fourth function the sell function it does what it 's name sonuds the user can sell the books they have.
-> The 5th function is the blogs where user can post they are experince about our product
->The 6th functiomn is the cart it takes the items choosen by the user to buy it also calcultes the total amoun tof all items.
->Now i must go to the admin side:
